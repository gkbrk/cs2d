#cs2d/libcs2d#
A C program to get the CS2D Serverlist from the USGN serverlist and ping all of them to get server data.

#Compiling#
There are multiple ways to compile libcs2d.

1. Running `make` or `make compile` will compile the code and leave an executable called _get\_servers_.
2. Running `make run` will compile the code and run the executable in one step.
3. Running `make test` will compile the code and perform memory tests using _valgrind_.
4. Running `make clean` will remove the executable and only leave the code files.
